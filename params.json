This includes academia, public and private organizations. I and many around the world are indebted to the thousands of volunteers who wrote code, fought lawsuits, wrote documentation, tested the bleeding edge, reported bugs, requested features, made donations or used and promoted FOSS.\r\nThis site is a tribute and a simple thank you for all these people. You will find tutorials, sample code, full application, philosophical rants, worthy news and so on. The tutorials will focus on designing and scaling system architectures, designing and improving systems performance and general high level support. These are the areas I most focus on: distributed architectures implemented atop public and private cloud. I will discuss both design and concrete examples using FOSS.\r\n\r\nAll constructive feedback is welcome\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
